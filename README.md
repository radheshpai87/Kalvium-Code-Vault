# Kalvium PSUP Questions Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I have uploaded all the questions I have solved from the **Kalvium PSUP Live Book** during my learning journey. This repository serves as a collection of problem-solving examples and solutions, which can be helpful for anyone looking to understand basic programming concepts and how to apply them in practical problems.
