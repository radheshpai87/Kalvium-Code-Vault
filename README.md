# Kalvium PSUP Questions Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I have uploaded all the questions I have solved from the **Kalvium PSUP Live Book** during my learning journey. This repository serves as a collection of problem-solving examples and solutions, which can be helpful for anyone looking to understand basic programming concepts and how to apply them in practical problems.

## üìö About

This repository includes solutions to various programming problems from the Kalvium PSUP (Programming, Structured, Unstructured Problems) curriculum. The solutions are written in languages I'm currently learning, with a focus on understanding the logic and problem-solving techniques.

### Languages Used
- **C++ (Primary)**
- Other languages might be added as I progress **(Welcome for contributions)**
  
## üåü Highlights
- Each question includes a detailed solution that passes all the test case.
- Organized by problem category or topic for ease of access.
- The name of problem **commented** on top of every code.
- Regularly updated as I solve more problems.
